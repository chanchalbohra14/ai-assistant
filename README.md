AI Assistant Web Application
This repository contains a web-based AI Assistant that demonstrates multiple AI functionalities with a user-friendly, visually appealing interface. The project showcases prompt engineering concepts, allowing users to interact with various AI-powered features in a cohesive UI.

Features
Four main AI functions:

ðŸ§  Question Answering: Get factual, concise, or detailed answers to any query.

ðŸ“„ Text Summarization: Summarize long texts into bullet points, executive summaries, or simple overviews.

âœ¨ Creative Content: Generate stories, poems, or essays with various creative styles.

ðŸ“š Study Advice: Receive practical study tips, comprehensive strategies, or motivational coaching.

Prompt style selection: Choose different prompt tones and complexity levels to tailor responses.

Interactive UI:

Responsive design optimized for desktop and mobile.

Dark-themed professional and modern aesthetic with smooth animations.

Function selection activates respective input forms without unwanted scroll.

The page scrolls smoothly only when user interacts directly with the expanded input area.

Output and interaction:

Generates AI responses with simulated content.

Copy to clipboard functionality for responses.

User feedback on helpfulness of answers.

Session-based interaction history with timestamps and summaries.

Usage statistics including total queries, positive feedback count, success rate, and most used function.

Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3 (with Flexbox and Grid)

JavaScript (vanilla) for front-end logic and interactive behaviors

Google Fonts (Poppins) for typography

Pure front-end: No backend except simulated AI responses for demonstration

How to Use
Clone or download the repository.

Open index.html (or the main HTML file) in any modern web browser.

Select a function by clicking one of the colored cards (e.g., "Question Answering").

Choose a prompt style among the available options.

Enter your query or input text in the displayed text area.

Click the Generate button to see an AI-generated response.

Copy responses easily using the 'Copy' button.

Provide feedback by selecting whether the response was helpful.

View your recent interactions and usage statistics at the bottom.

Notes
The AI response content is simulated for demonstration and testing purposes. Replace the generateResponse function with your preferred AI API integration for real AI-powered outputs.

The UI is optimized for various screen sizes, with two-column layouts on tablets and stacked single-column on smaller devices.

The page scroll behavior is carefully designed: no automatic scroll occurs on function selection; smooth scroll only happens when the user interacts directly with the input area, providing an intuitive user experience.

Future Improvements
Integrate actual AI backend with API calls for live responses.

Store interaction history and statistics in browser local storage or backend for persistence.

Enhance accessibility features (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).

Add user authentication for personalized profiles and saved sessions.

Offer dark/light theme toggle.
